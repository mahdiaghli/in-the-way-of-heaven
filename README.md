Developed a terminal-based ecosystem simulation game in C++ where animals compete to reach "Heaven" while managing energy, breeding, and survival. Key features include:

Pathfinding & AI: Implemented the A* algorithm for intelligent animal navigation around obstacles (walls, other animals) toward objectives (food, Heaven).

Game Mechanics: Designed systems for combat, breeding, energy management, and dynamic interactions (helping allies, attacking rivals).

User Interaction: Created a console-based UI with color-coded maps, real-time stats, and user input handling for movement/actions.

Persistence: Added save/load functionality and playback logging (HumanLog.txt, PlayBack.txt) to track game states and events.

Procedural Content: Generated randomized maps with configurable entities (food, blocks, animals) for varied gameplay.

Technologies: C++, File I/O, Algorithm Design (A*), Modular Architecture (multi-header structure), Linux/Windows compatibility.
